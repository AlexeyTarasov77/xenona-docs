# What is Xenona?

Xenona is a fully on-chain giveaway platform designed to make prize campaigns transparent, automated, and trustless. It allows anyone to **create**, **join**, and **win** giveaways, while ensuring that every step — from prize funding to winner selection — is verifiable on the blockchain.

Traditional giveaways rely heavily on trust: trust that the host actually holds the prize, trust that the rules won’t change, and trust that the winner is chosen fairly. Xenona removes this uncertainty entirely. By using smart contracts, Xenona turns giveaways into automated processes that cannot be manipulated — not even by the creator.

Xenona supports both creators and participants:

- **Creators** can launch giveaways backed by real on-chain assets. Once deployed, the smart contract handles everything automatically: managing entries, validating requirements, and selecting the winner using verifiable randomness.
- **Participants** can join giveaways knowing the prize is locked in the contract, entry rules are transparent, and the draw is provably fair.

At its core, Xenona brings together two things Web3 users value most:  
**fairness guaranteed by code** and **engaging prize experiences built for communities**.

Whether you're growing a project, rewarding your audience, or simply exploring new ways to create engagement, Xenona offers a trustless, fully automated system where everyone can participate with confidence.
